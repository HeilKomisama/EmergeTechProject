**THIS PROJECT WAS MODIFIED TO BE OPENABLE IN NETBEANS**

Notes for testing (IN NETBEANS):
-Make a jpalibs library found and import the JARs found in the provided Library Imports folder; VSC notices errors because it couldn't find the libraries required for JPA, I'm not sure how to import them to the project so it is runnable in VSC.
-The database is run in MySQL, edit the persistence.xml file to match your root password
-All files are found in the employeeManagementSystem folder; It is essentially @estrellar's UI + function work merged with my database stuff so it works with MySQL.

Bugs:
-Edit and Save didn't work on my testing; I might've missed something

Messages from Ashtin:
-If someone could do the UI for the other interfaces that would be great
-I will try to fix and optimize the other functions further and fix the bugs for save/edit the next time I wake up
-I will also try to work on the other page functions after it finishes
-Good luck to us! My brain died btw
